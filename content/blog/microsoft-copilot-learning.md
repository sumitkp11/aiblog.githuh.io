## Introduction to Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat

Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat is a secure AI assistant for work. It is available with Microsoft 365 subscription at no additional cost. It is designed to serve as a powerful AI assistant to streamline work and boost productivity.

It helps you with tasks such as summarizing, brainstorming, writing, coding and searching. It also provides intelligent suggestions and automates repetitive tasks.

## Writing Effective Prompts

Writing effective prompts is a great way to perform tasks in Copilot Chat such as creating, summarizing, editing or transforming content.

The four important key elements for effective prompts are:

**Context**  
Tell the chatbot *why* you need something and *who* is involved. Provide detailed context and specifics for better responses.

**Goal**  
Tell the chatbot *what* you want it to do. Including examples of output can help shape the response.

**Source**  
Tell the chatbot *where* to look for information. This can include files you upload or public URLs you want it to reference.

**Expectations**  
Tell the chatbot *how* to deliver the answer—tone, style, length, and audience.

**Example Prompt:**  
> *"I work in marketing focusing on competitor research. Give me a concise summary of recent news about Microsoft, using web articles from the last 2 months. Provide the answer in two to three paragraphs and use a business tone."*

### Do’s and Don’ts of Prompting
